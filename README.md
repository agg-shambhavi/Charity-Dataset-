# Charity-Dataset-
Here, The is data collected from the U.S. census, to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people who are most likely to donate to their cause. Here, we have to predict that if the income of a row is '&lt;=50' or '>50'. I have used 9 different algorithms to check which performs the best on the data and then tuned it according to the dataset.
